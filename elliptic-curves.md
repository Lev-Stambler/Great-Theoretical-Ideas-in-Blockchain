-- Slide 9, add proof for why $4A^3 + 27B^2$ cannot be zero
-- Slide 24, add intuitive proof. Tie in what a commutative group is
  - P + O = P because the point which is not P or O which is on the curve and the vertical line is -P. The reflection of that is then just P
  - P + -P = 0. It forms the vertical line, then defn of 0
  - Associativity is hard apparently
  - P + Q = Q + P?
-- Slide 30 ish, whats a subgroup?
-- Slide 33, what does E(F37) ∼= C3 × C15 mean?

-- Slide 37: what does a group look like... ? Lattice?



Whats a $F^*_P$ group? (Thomson Group under multiplication?)
